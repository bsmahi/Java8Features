# Stream API

Stream API was introduced in Java 8. It provided a *declartive programming* approach to iterate and perform operations over a collection. Until Java 7, *for* and *for each* were the only options available, which was an *imperative programming* approach. Let me introduce you to the Stream API and how it provides an abstraction over the common operations performed over a collection.

*While using **Imperative Programming**, the developer uses the language constructs to write both **what to do and how to do**. Whereas while using **Declarative Programming**, developer has to focus only on defining **what to do** and the language or the framework takes care of the **how to do** part. Hence in Declarative Programming, the code is concise and less error-prone.*

The operations that are generally performed over a collection can be categorized into the following. Below mentioned operations in the examples for introducing the *Stream* API.

* Transforming
* Filtering
* Searching
* Reordering
* Summarizing
* Grouping
